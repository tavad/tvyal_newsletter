# Armenia's Economic Mirage: Unveiling the Reality Behind GDP Growth

Armenia's economy stands at a critical juncture, with recent GDP growth revisions exposing a troubling reality. The nation's celebrated economic boom, it appears, was largely built on unsustainable factors. As we delve into the data, a stark picture emerges of an economy facing significant challenges beneath its surface of apparent prosperity.

## GDP Growth: The Great Unraveling

### The Illusion of Prosperity

Recent downward revisions of GDP growth figures open a wholesale reevaluation of the country's real economic health.

Plot 1 reveals the volatility of Armenia's economic journey. While the long-term average growth hovers around 4.5%, recent years have seen significant fluctuations. The latest revisions bring these figures closer to the historical average, raising questions about the sustainability of recent growth.

### Unmasking the Growth Mirage

The revision saga is dramatic and far-reaching:

1. Q1 2024 growth has been revised down from 9.2% to 6.6% - a substantial 2.6 percentage point decrease.
2. Q4 2023 growth has been adjusted from 7.7% to 6.4% - a 1.3 percentage point reduction.

These aren't minor adjustments; they represent a fundamental reassessment of Armenia's economic reality, as before the revision it appeared that economy is growing, but after there is an apparent stagnation.

Plot 3 provides a sobering before-and-after picture. The industrial sector (C), once hailed as the engine of growth contributing 4.0 percentage points to GDP growth in Q1 2024, now accounts for a mere 1.2 points. This staggering adjustment reveals the fragility of Armenia's recent growth.

### The Gold Rush Fallacy

At the heart of this statistical drama lies the gold re-export phenomenon. Beginning in November 2023 and continuing with significant momentum until May 2024, this sector injected apparent vitality into Armenia's growth figures. However, the recent revisions have effectively eliminated its contribution to GDP growth.

It's worth noting that the annual economic growth rate for 2023 still stands at 8.7% and has not yet been revised. Our forecast at the end of 2023 predicted economic growth of about 7%. However, the significant increase in gold re-exports from November inflated economic growth to 8.7% against the backdrop of overall economic decline, creating an expensive effect. It can be expected that the 8.7% annual economic growth for 2023 may also be revised down to around 7.5%.

## Economic Sectors and Their Contributions

### Overview of Sector Performance

[Insert Plot 2 here]

Plot 2 reveals stark differences in growth rates across various industries, indicating that economic growth is not evenly distributed or sustainable.

Key observations:
1. The IT sector (J), once a growth engine with a 62.6% year-on-year increase in Q2 2023, has experienced a significant decline. In Q2 2024, it showed a 14.1% year-on-year decrease.
2. Other sectors, including public catering (I) and transportation (H), are also declining.
3. Growth in major economic drivers like construction (F) and trade (G) is slowing down.

### IT Sector Decline and Its Implications

The IT sector's downturn is particularly concerning. After three consecutive quarters of decline, this once-booming sector is no longer contributing significantly to GDP growth. This trend raises questions about the sustainability of Armenia's tech-driven growth strategy and the factors behind this reversal.

### Current Growth Drivers

Plot 5 shows the contributors to GDP growth in Q2 2024:

1. Wholesale and retail trade (G) accounts for 3.1 percentage points of the 6.4% GDP growth, nearly half of the total.
2. Real estate transactions (L) contribute 2.3 percentage points, about a third of the growth. This is a significant increase from its usual contribution of around 0.5 percentage points.
3. The financial sector (K) contributes 1.9 percentage points.

The substantial contribution from real estate transactions is noteworthy. It includes "Imputed rental value for owner-occupied dwellings," essentially estimating potential rent for all housing in Armenia, regardless of whether it's owner-occupied or rented. This means that about a third of the 6.4% growth is attributed to increased market value of real estate, which may not be sustainable.

## Sustainability of Economic Growth

The recent GDP revisions and sector-specific analysis raise important questions about the sustainability of Armenia's economic growth.

### Analysis of Growth Drivers

[Insert Plot 4 here]

Plot 4 illustrates the contributions to Armenia's economic growth by quarter. Several key points emerge:

1. Long-term average growth: Armenia's long-term average economic growth rate is around 4.5%. Any system tends to revert to its long-term average unless there are qualitative changes that can ensure stable, long-term added value creation.

2. Post-COVID recovery: After the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and the 44-day war, the economy showed signs of recovery. The main sectors of the economy provided about 4.5% of economic growth.

3. IT sector contribution: The IT sector (J) contributed about 1-2.5 percentage points to growth, largely due to the relocation of Russian IT specialists. However, this sector has been in decline for the past three quarters.

4. Financial services and trade: The main growth has been provided by financial services (K) and trade. It's worth noting that due to the large inflow of capital from Russia, the net profit of the banking system tripled in 2022.

5. Recent trends: From early 2022 to mid-2023, most sectors showed stable contributions to economic growth. However, since then, almost all economic activity classifiers have been recording a decline in their contribution to overall economic growth.

### Dependence on Temporary and Artificial Factors

The data reveals that Armenia's economic growth has been largely driven by external factors:

1. In 2022, there was a significant inflow of capital from Russia.
2. From November 2023, large-scale gold re-exports boosted growth figures.
3. Growth is mainly provided by trade, real estate, and financial services, which are dependent on external factors.

These factors, while providing short-term boosts, do not represent sustainable, long-term drivers of economic growth.

## Fiscal Implications

The sustainability issues in economic growth have direct implications for Armenia's fiscal situation.

### Tax Revenue Collection Issues

There is currently a significant 9% under-collection of tax revenues. This shortfall is leading to discussions about potential budget expenditure cuts.

### Budget Expenditure Considerations

Plans are being considered to use about 150 billion drams from the reserve fund to cover expenses in the face of revenue shortfalls. This situation increases the likelihood of growth in public debt.

### Potential Increase in Public Debt

Several factors contribute to the risk of increasing public debt:

1. If the 7% economic growth rate prescribed by the budget law is not achieved, and instead the long-term average of 4.5% is realized, the government may need to allocate about half of the reserve fund to cover the difference.

2. In conditions of 2.5% or less economic growth, we may be forced to increase public debt.

3. The current positive long-term GDP growth forecasts lack a solid foundation for sustainable, long-term value-added growth.

## Conclusion

The recent GDP revisions and sector-specific analyses paint a concerning picture of Armenia's economic future. The heavy reliance on sectors sensitive to external factors and temporary boosts from activities like gold re-exports suggests that without significant structural changes, maintaining high growth rates will be challenging.

The IT sector's decline, the unsustainable nature of real estate contributions to GDP, and the potential fiscal challenges all point to an economy at a crossroads. The risk of growing public debt and potential fiscal instability in the coming years cannot be ignored.

As it stands, our long-term GDP growth forecasts are not positive (ՀՆԱ աճի մեր երկարաժամկետ կանխատեսումները այս պահին դրական չեն). Without a solid foundation for sustainable, long-term value-added growth, Armenia may find itself chasing economic mirages rather than building lasting prosperity. The coming months and years will be crucial in determining whether the country can pivot towards more sustainable economic strategies or continue to rely on volatile and temporary growth factors.
